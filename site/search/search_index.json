This means that they are stored separately in your database, and linked to. The benefit of this is that any time you have an object by \"B. Weigel\", instead of typing \"B. Weigel\" or \"Brandon Weigel\" or another form in the Name field, you select the canonical name from a list, and create a link to the \"B. Weigel\" entity.
