# Metadata Mapping

Metadata mapping is a work-in-progress. In 2022, discoverygarden provided 
us with an exhaustive list of XPATHs present in the repository, which were 
mapped by Arca Admins to a proposed new metadata profile (i.e. list of 
fields).

- [Proposed metadata 
profile](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHIoxWTOMA6dYMl7h45ykGlaQIqpBvR_i29mN8BrB_Q/edit?usp=sharing)

These were approved by Arca Admins in 2022. As the migration project 
progresses, some tweaks may be made.
