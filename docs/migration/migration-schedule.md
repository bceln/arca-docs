# Migration Schedule

The schedule below is a rough draft only; it contains no specific dates, and will be firmed up as we progress. This schedule is predicated on timely bug fixes; all timing is subject to change, particularly at this early stage.

The document will be available at this same link as it gets updated.

If you have any questions or concerns about your position on the schedule, or changes to request, please contact the Arca office.

Be sure to [complete all preparatory tasks](/arca-docs/migration/migration-tasks/migration-preparation) as your time draws near. Ensure that your staff are available during this time.
