# Training

This page collects training resources produced by the Arca office, as well as links to external training resources.

All Arca admins should review the Arca Orientation prior to getting started in Arca.

Basic Training is provided via live interactive sessions, but a recorded session will be made available here as well.

Arca members can practice and get acquainted with the system in the [Arca Sandbox](https://bceln.i8.dgicloud.com/). Request an account by contacting the Arca Office.

## Orientation

The Arca Orientation is required viewing for all new Arca Admins, and is useful information for directors and managers of Arca partner organizations as well. It provides an overview of Arca's history and context; explains and demonstrates how the service works; and outlines your roles and responsibilities as members, and Arca's responsibilities to you.

## Basic Training

Basic Training takes Arca admins through the key concepts and skills required to work in an Islandora repository and to participate in Arca. It covers:

* Logging in and accessing your site
* Navigation and Components of an Islandora site, including:
    * Collections
    * Search and browsing
    * Content types
    * Metadata
    * Media viewers
    * Paged content
    * Non-Islandora pages
* Theming customization

Basic training requires access to the Arca sandbox; contact the Arca Office for an account.

Basic training sessions are held periodically, particularly when new members join Arca. To arrange a live Basic Training session, contact the Arca Office.

If a live session is not available, members can work along with a recorded session. It is the same as a normal Basic Training session, but without a live instructor.

## Specialized modules

Training modules for specific features of the system will be compiled here. These will include:

* Embargo and other access controls
* Batch ingest with Islandora Workbench
* Other tools and features
