# How Arca Works

Arca is a collaborative initiative that puts the development and implementation of a digital repository within reach for every organisation, at a reasonable cost, and in a supported environment. Arca runs on 
[Islandora](https://islandora.ca), in the SFU Cloud Computing environment.

Arca is a service of the [BC Electronic Library Network](https://bceln.ca). For details about Arca, how to join, fees, etc., [see the BC ELN website](https://bceln.ca/services-initiatives/shared-services/arca).
