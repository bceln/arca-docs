# Getting Support

If you need help, submit a support ticket to the Arca Office in one of two ways:

1. Send an email describing your issue or question to arca-help[at]bceln.ca
2. Open a new ticket directly on the ticketing system at https://support.bceln.ca.

Connect with your fellow Arca Admins:

- Mailing list: arcaadmins[at]bceln.ca
- Mattermost: Contact the Arca Office for access to the Mattermost server.

Connect with other Islandora users on the Islandora Slack: contact the Arca Office for an invite.
