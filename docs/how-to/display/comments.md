# Enable comments on Repository Items

Islandora provides a way for users to comment on repository items. The comment form is disabled by default, but you can enable it by doing the following.

1. Go to `Structure -> Content types -> Repository Item -> Manage display`
2. Click the `Comment` line
3. Scroll down and find the `Comment` field
4. Move it above the `Disabled` section
5. Save

Users will now be able to comment on your objects.

To disable commenting, follow the same steps, and move the Comment field into the `Disabled` section.
