# Introduction to Batch Operations

In the new Islandora, batch ingests and other batch operations are performed with a command-line tool called [Islandora Workbench](https://github.com/mjordan/islandora_workbench).

Batch tasks that can be run with Islandora Workbench include but are not limited to:

* Batch ingests
* Metadata revisions
* Taxonomy term imports
* Updates to or deletions of media

Comprehensive documentation for Islandora Workbench by the tool's [creator/maintainer](https://github.com/mjordan) can be found here: [https://mjordan.github.io/islandora_workbench_docs/](https://mjordan.github.io/islandora_workbench_docs/). The pages on this site distill the more comprehensive documentation into the essentials for immediate use with Arca.
