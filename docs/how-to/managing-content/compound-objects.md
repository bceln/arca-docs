# Compound Objects

Compound objects are a sort of sub-collection that link several Repository Items together. When looking at a compound object, users see all of its child objects (or "parts"), and can navigate between them.

To create a compound object, create the Compound Parent first. 

1. Add a new Repository Item.
2. Fill in the metadata form. Under Model, select "Compound".
3. Save.

Then, create your child items:

1. Add a new Repository Item. 
2. Fill in the metadata form. Under `Collection(s)`, start entering the title of your Compound Parent, and click the result that comes up.
3. Save, add media, etc.

To add an existing item as a child of your Compound Object:

1. Navigate to that item, and Edit.
2. Under Collections, create a reference to your Compound Object.
3. Save.

To remove a child item from a Compound Object:

1. Edit the child item.
2. Under Collections, remove the reference to the Compound Object. You may also add a new reference to another parent (e.g. a collection).
3. Save.
