# Metatags

The [Metatag module](https://www.drupal.org/project/metatag) and its various submodules produce HTML tags that tell search engines and other automated systems what your site is about, and how to deal with it.

This is important for search engine optimization, Google Scholar harvesting, automatic page previews in social sharing, and other functions.

While it mostly works out of the box, you need to do some configuration to customize its actions.
