When working with PDF issues, please refer to the Single Object Content guidance above.</p> <p>Ingests of paged content differ in that the media files for each child item are separated into their own subdirectory. Instead of a <code>file</code> column, the metadata spreadsheet contains a <code>directory</code> column to point to the subdirectory containing all media files for that child. These subdirectories should include image files at the very least, but may optionally contain OCR/HOCR text files if available for each page.</p> <p>While paged content parents and children can technically be ingested in the same batch as long as they appear sequentially in the spreadsheet (parent before children), the Arca Office recommends creating parent objects as a separate, primary step. Creating the parents (e.g. collections, books and newspapers) separately from the children reduces the opportunities for human error and issues with sequencing, field or value templates, etc.</p> <p>Before preparing paged content, make sure to review the official Islandora documentation on filenaming and subdirectory structure to ensure the proper sequence of pages is maintained upon ingest.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/batch-operations/create/#an-important-note-on-paragraphs","title":"An Important Note on Paragraphs","text":"<p>Arca's installation of Islandora makes extensive use of Paragraphs, a special Drupal unit that allows for sets of repeatable fields. A list of all of the Paragraph types available by default in an Arca site can be viewed at <code>/admin/structure/paragraphs_type</code>. One of the most important Paragraph types is Origin Information, which includes the primary date field for all repository items (<code>field_date_issued</code>).</p> <p>Because repository items being ingested may have metadata in fields that are part of Paragraphs, these fields must be accounted for in the config YAML for the task. Arca's config YAML templates for both paged content and single object content include all possible Paragraph fields by default.</p> <p>If you are ingesting a batch of items that does not make use of a particular subfield in a paragraph, the row for that subfield can be nulled out by adding a <code>#</code> to the start of the line in the config file. Any null/blank values that aren't nulled out with <code>#</code> will need to be accounted for with double delimiters in each row of the metadata. See Paragraph Data Entry for further detail.</p> <p>Let's take a closer look at how Paragraphs and their subfields are structured in the config YAML templates. The following excerpt of the paged content config YAML template lists the fields for the Origin Information Paragraph:</p> <pre><code>paragraph_fields:\n  node:\n    field_origin_information:\n      type: origin_information\n      field_order:\n        - field_event_type\n        - field_place\n        - field_date_issued\n        - field_date_captured\n        - field_other_date\n        - field_copyright_date\n        - field_publisher\n        - field_edition\n        - field_issuance\n        - field_frequency\n      field_delimiter: ':'\n      subdelimiter: '|'\n</code></pre> <p>In this example:</p> <ul> <li><code>field_origin_information</code> is the machine name of the Paragraph's field on Repository Items. It can be found on your site here: <code>/admin/structure/types/manage/islandora_object/fields</code>. This is the field name/header that you will be adding values under in your metadata CSV.</li> <li><code>type</code> is the machine name of the Paragraph Type, available here: <code>/admin/structure/paragraphs_type</code>. It's usually just the field name without <code>field_</code>.</li> <li><code>field_order</code> is followed by a list of subfields that exist within that paragraph. As noted earlier in this section, you can null out any subfields you are not using by adding a <code>#</code> to the start of the subfield's line in the config file.</li> <li><code>field_delimiter</code> is the chosen delimiter between each of the subfields in the paragraph.</li> <li><code>subdelimiter</code> is the chosen delimiter between several paragraphs on the same object (i.e., multiple Origin Information paragraphs)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"how-to/batch-operations/create/#paragraph-data-entry","title":"Paragraph Data Entry","text":""},{"location":"how-to/batch-operations/create/#single-paragraph","title":"Single Paragraph","text":"<p>The metadata spreadsheet templates contain columns for Paragraph fields as a whole.

The content will always be accessible from that path; your custom path is an alias, and can be changed as desired.</p>"},{"location":"how-to/display/pathauto/#configuring-pathauto-patterns","title":"Configuring Pathauto patterns","text":"<p>Pathauto produces URLs based on tokens - pieces of information drawn from Drupal fields; that is, your item's metadata. By default, Arca produces a URL for Repository Item nodes based on their Title. You can change this and produce more sophisticated or complex URLs if you desire.</p> <p>To access Pathauto configuration, go to <code>/admin/config/search/path/patterns</code>. </p> <p>If you want to use a new pattern and not the default, click the dropdown under Operations and choose <code>Disable</code>. This way you can always go back to the original version.</p> <p>To create a new pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Click the <code>Add Pathauto pattern</code> button</li> <li>Under <code>Pattern type</code>, choose <code>Content</code></li> <li>Under <code>Content type</code>, choose <code>Repository Item</code></li> <li>In the <code>Path Pattern</code> field, enter the pattern you want to create, using tokens from your Repository Item fields. <ul> <li>How this works:<ul> <li>Patterns are based on tokens, which are references to Drupal fields.</li> <li>To see the tokens available to you, click the <code>Browse available tokens</code> link. You will see the available tokens organized by category.</li> <li>Click the <code>Nodes</code> category to produce a list of all the fields that exist on Drupal nodes.</li> <li>Click the token you want to add to push it to the <code>Path Pattern</code> field.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Example: <code>[node:field_member_of]/[node:title]</code> will produce a path using the parent item's title followed by the item's title.<ul> <li>e.g. \"My Image\" in the \"Beautiful Images\" collection will have the URl <code>yoursite.arcabc.ca/beautiful-images/my-image</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If you expand on the field token, you can drill into more details. For example, drilling into <code>[node:field_member_of]</code>, you could instead choose <code>[node:field_member_of:0:target_id]</code>, which produces the Node ID instead of the title.<ul> <li>Using this option with the above example, your path would instead look like <code>yoursite.arcabc.ca/13/my-image</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Give it a label so you remember what it means, and save.</li> </ul> <p>Note that complex hierarchical paths are not possible. Pathauto tokens are only available for (1) metadata fields and other information directly from the node in question, and (2) the parent item's name and node number [no other parent metadata].</p>"},{"location":"how-to/display/pathauto/#setting-custom-urls-manually","title":"Setting custom URLs manually","text":"<p>When creating or editing any Drupal object, including Repository Items, you have the option to manually set the URL Alias.</p> <p>While filling out the fields for your Repository Item, look at the sidebar to the right.

This means that they are stored separately in your database, and linked to. The benefit of this is that any time you have an object by \"B. Weigel\", instead of typing \"B. Weigel\" or \"Brandon Weigel\" or another form in the Name field, you select the canonical name from a list, and create a link to the \"B. Weigel\" entity. Same with Genre, Role, and Subject.</p> <p>In order for our migrated metadata to be accurate, those terms and names must be correct and consistent across all Islandora objects. Each different value under <code>&lt;genre&gt;</code> will create a separate taxonomy entry -- it will be bad for your repository to have \"Book\", \"book\", \"books\", and \"Books.\" as different options with different objects collected under them.</p> <p>Similarly, you don't want your repository collecting some works under \"B. Weigel\" and others under \"Brandon Weigel\" if they all belong to the same author.</p> <p>This cleanup task must be done before the migration, because the creation of those terms is automated.

Select the Solr Query option and enter the following text: <code>RELS_EXT_isMemberOf_uri_mt:\"PID\"</code> (replacing <code>\"PID\"</code> with the PID for the newspaper collection). This will export all of the child objects for that newspaper. For example, to make batch metadata edits, select the MODS datastream.</p> How do I control how my collections are sorted? <p>You can use Solr fields to determine how your collections' objects are sorted.</p> <ol> <li>Make sure that your Collection Solution Pack is configured to use Solr for display generation <code>(admin/islandora/solution_pack_config/basic_collection)</code></li> <li>Under \u201cSort field for collection query\u201d, enter your chosen field followed by <code>asc</code> or <code>desc</code>.

Scroll down to find the option \"Use Standard Metadata Display\". Make sure it is checked.  </p> <p>Scholar defaults to its own metadata display, COinS. This display is not configurable, and so is probably not the best choice for objects in Arca.</p> One of my display fields shows multiple values instead of just one. How do I fix it? <p>When viewing an object, one or more of the metadata display fields shows several values in it, from several different elements that were added separately to the ingest form. How can I display one specific value?  </p> <p>Your metadata display profile (or Solr search result field, or wherever you're using a Solr field) is probalby using the Dublin Core Solr field (<code>dc.description</code>, <code>dc.identifier</code>, etc.) rather than the more granular MODS Solr field. Dublin Core is not as precise as MODS, and many DC elements combine different MODS elements into one.  </p> <p>For example, <code>dc.description</code> will combine MODS abstract, and all MODS note elements. If you want to display just one of these, choose the MODS field that contains the specific piece of metadata you require.</p> My object doesn't display the fields I want. Do I need to change the ingest form? <p>No!  </p> <p>Your ingest form is probably fine. Solr generates many fields based on the metadata you ingest via the form, and your object's content model metadata display profile is only configured to display a certain selection of those. You can configure the fields used in your Solr Metadata Display in admin/islandora/search/islandora_solr/metadata.  </p> <p>For detailed assistance with this, including ways to find out which fields you should be using, review the Metadata Display Arca Hour.</p>"},{"location":"troubleshooting/troubleshooting-i7/#enhancements","title":"Enhancements","text":"Some objects are not downloadable by end users.

The module creates a block which appears on any objects that (a) do not have a PDF datastrea, and (b) do have a free fulltext link available through oadoi.org, and offers a link for the user to access the fulltext externally.  </p> <p>To use Islandora oaDOI: </p> <ol> <li>Go to Modules (admin/modules), and enable (1) Islandora Badges, and (2) Islandora oaDOI. </li> <li>Configure Islandora Badges (under Islandora Utility modules, or admin/islandora/tools/badges), and make sure that the Thesis and Citation content models are selected.</li> <li>In the Blocks menu (admin/structure/block), find the block titled \"Islandora oaDOI Link\" and add it to the region of your choice.
